# Prog02: Create a program that ask user to input 2 numbers. Print "Not Equal" when the numbers are not the same.

# Adding a warning text that inputs must be in integers only
print("\n(For inputs, integers are only acceptable)")

# User inputs
number_1 = int(input("\nInput the first number: "))
number_2 = int(input("Input the second number: "))

# If number 1 is greater than number 2
# Print "Not Equal"
# If number 1 is less than number 2
# Print "Not Equal"
# If number 1 is equal to number 2
# Print that the two numbers are equal
